To achieve the function of RISC V2.1 RV32I&RV32E subset
|--There are three documents in folder 'work3':
  |--|--code:Our code including 9 files. 
    |--|--CONST.py : Defining system constants
    |--|--D_MEM.py : achieving access to data in memory
    |--|--I_MEM.py : achieving access to instruction in memory
    |--|--initialization.py : Initializing the system
    |--|--instructionSet.py : Implementing the function of the instruction
    |--|--main.py : The entrance function of the system
    |--|--data.md : The datas needing to load before executing program 
    |--|--instructions.md : The instruction of your program 
  |--|--test:We provide three copies of the code ,including AllInstructions test & BullbleSort test & GCD_LCM(Greatest common divisor AND Least common multiple),to test our system.The first number on the result of BullbleSort is the number of the data that to participate in sorting
  |--|--instructionSet:We summed up all instruction of the  RV32I&RV32E except the system instructions and privilege commands.
|--Be careful
  |--|--Your program must be written in the file 'instructions.md' and your data must be wrote in the file 'data.md'
  |--|--Vision of the python is 3.5.2
|--something else 
  |--I'm sorry about that our code annotation is written by chinese,if  any messy code,please tell me.E-mail : collincaichenglin@foxmail.com.

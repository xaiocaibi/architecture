To achieve the function of RISC V2.1 RV32I&RV32E subset<br>
|--There are three documents in folder 'work3':<br>
>  |--|--code: Our code including 9 files. <br>
 >>   |--|--CONST.py : Defining system constants<br>
 >> |--|--D_MEM.py : achieving access to data in memory<br>
 >> |--|--I_MEM.py : achieving access to instruction in memory<br>
 >> |--|--initialization.py : Initializing the system<br>
 >> |--|--instructionSet.py : Implementing the function of the instruction<br>
 >> |--|--main.py : The entrance function of the system<br>
 >> |--|--data.md : The datas needing to load before executing program <br>
 >> |--|--instructions.md : The instruction of your program <br>
 >|--|--test:We provide three copies of the code ,including AllInstructions test & BullbleSort test & GCD_LCM(Greatest common divisor AND Least common multiple),to test our system.The first number on the result of BullbleSort is the number of the data that to participate in sorting<br>
 >|--|--instructionSet:We summed up all instruction of the  RV32I&RV32E except the system instructions and privilege commands.
>|--Be careful<br>
 >> |--|--Your program must be written in the file 'instructions.md' and your data must be wrote in the file 'data.md'
  >>|--|--Vision of the python is 3.5.2<br>
>|--something else <br>
 >> |--I'm sorry about that our code annotation is written by chinese,if  any messy code,please tell me.E-mail : <br>collincaichenglin@foxmail.com.
